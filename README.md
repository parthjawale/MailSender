# MailSender
An API to send mails through Lambda.
Deliberately kept node_modules as it contains only one library.

# Update
Update index.js to add the details as asked. Update the service as required or update the SMTP server if required.

# How to Set Up
Create a new Lambda function and add the updated index.js file to the function.

# How to Run
Create a new API Gateway project and connect it to this Lambda function to run.
Set the response type as JSON to ensure proper running.
